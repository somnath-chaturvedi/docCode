CRITICAL: The generated HTML/CSS MUST look EXACTLY the same as the attached PNG design image. Pixel-perfect accuracy is required.

Generate HTML and CSS files that precisely replicate the attached PNG design with the following requirements:

EXACT VISUAL REPLICATION:
- Match colors EXACTLY using a color picker from the image (include hex codes)
- Replicate font sizes, weights, and line heights precisely
- Copy exact spacing, padding, and margins (measure pixel distances)
- Maintain exact proportions and dimensions for all elements
- Match border radius, shadows, and visual effects exactly
- Use the same image aspect ratios and positioning
- Preserve exact alignment of all elements

FILE STRUCTURE:
- Create index.html and styles.css files
- Link CSS file in HTML head section

HTML REQUIREMENTS:
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Assign unique, descriptive IDs to major sections (e.g., id="hero-section", id="product-grid")
- Use BEM naming convention for classes (e.g., class="header__nav-link--active")
- All IDs and class names must be unique and meaningful
- Include proper alt text and accessibility attributes

CSS REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract and use the EXACT colors from the PNG (use hex values)
- Define CSS custom properties for all colors, fonts, and spacing values
- Use precise pixel measurements for spacing, sizing, and typography
- Implement the exact layout structure (Flexbox/Grid) matching the design
- Add exact border-radius, box-shadows, and other visual effects
- Make it responsive while maintaining the exact look on all screen sizes
- Use appropriate font families (if recognizable) or specify web-safe alternatives

MEASUREMENT PRECISION:
- Calculate exact pixel values for widths, heights, padding, and margins
- Match exact font sizes and line heights
- Replicate precise spacing between elements
- Ensure button sizes, icon sizes match exactly

ITERATIVE REFINEMENT:
- Compare the rendered output with the original PNG
- Adjust code iteratively until it matches 99%+ pixel accuracy
- Fine-tune any discrepancies in spacing, colors, or alignment

OUTPUT:
- Production-ready, clean, well-commented code
- Organized CSS with logical grouping
- No placeholder content - extract actual text from the image
