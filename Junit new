Generate comprehensive JUnit5 test cases for the class `[YourClassName]` with the following critical requirements:
Coverage Requirements
•	Achieve 100% line coverage for all methods in the class
•	Test all method types: public, private, protected, package-private, static, and instance methods
•	Cover all code branches, including if-else statements, switch cases, loops, and exception handling paths
•	Test all edge cases: null values, empty collections, zero/negative numbers, minimum/maximum values, boundary conditions, and invalid inputs[sonarsource]
Testing Approach for Different Method Types
1.	Public methods: Test directly using standard JUnit5 assertions
2.	Private methods: Use Java Reflection API to test private methods by using `getDeclaredMethod()` and `setAccessible(true)`[educative]
3.	Static methods: Test directly by calling the static methods on the class
4.	Protected/package-private methods: Test directly from the same package structure
Critical Constraints
•	DO NOT suggest any modifications to the existing class under test - the class cannot be changed
•	All test cases must compile and run successfully without requiring changes to the original class
•	If private methods exist, implement reflection-based testing approach rather than suggesting to change method visibility[educative]
Test Case Structure Requirements
Generate test cases using JUnit5 annotations and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:[sonarsource]
•	`@Test` for each test method
•	`@BeforeEach` for setup if needed
•	`@AfterEach` for cleanup if needed
•	Use descriptive test method names that clearly indicate what is being tested
•	Include assertions using `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` methods
Additional Requirements
•	Mock external dependencies using Mockito where necessary
•	Test exception scenarios using `assertThrows()`
•	Parameterize tests using `@ParameterizedTest` where multiple similar test cases exist
•	Include comments explaining complex test scenarios
•	Verify that each test case is independent and can run in isolation
•	Ensure all assertions are meaningful and verify expected behavior[graphite]
Expected Deliverables
1.	Complete test class with all necessary imports
2.	Test methods covering every line of code in `[YourClassName]`
3.	Helper methods for reflection-based private method testing if applicable[educative]
4.	Mock setups for any dependencies
5.	Verification that 100% line coverage is achievable with these tests
